# Predicting Housing Prices

This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating residential property prices using a dataset scraped from MagicBricks (available on Kaggle). It involves data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and comparing the performance of various machine learning models on scaled and unscaled datasets.

## Features
- Dataset cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Hypothesis testing to analyze feature relationships with prices.
- Model evaluation using techniques like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and MLP Regressor.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA to optimize training efficiency.

## Results
Random Forest demonstrated the best performance in terms of accuracy and reliability, making it the preferred model for price prediction.

## Future Scope
Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional data sources and experimenting with advanced ensemble techniques.

For detailed implementation and analysis, refer to the project code and report.
